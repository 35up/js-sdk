# 35up Javascript SDK

This library provides with Javascript apis to integrate 35up
into your online shop.

You could include it into you code statically as an npm package
```$xslt
npm i -S @35up/js-sdk
```

or you can include it dynamically by inserting the following tag into your HTML:
```$xslt
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.35up.com/35up-js-sdk.js"></script>
```

In this case all the api will be available from the global object 
`thirtyFiveUp`
